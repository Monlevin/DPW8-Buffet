Limiter filter on/off refers to the spatial discretization gradient limiter in Fluent.

"Limiter filter on": Applies the limiter without smoothing.

"Limiter filter off": Smooths how the limiter is applied between neighboring cells to reduce limiter-induced noise/instability.

When processing time series of Kulite points, nearest mesh node location was used given the high mesh resolution.
