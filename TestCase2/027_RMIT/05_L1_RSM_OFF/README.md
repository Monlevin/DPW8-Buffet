Limiter filter on/off refers to the spatial discretization gradient limiter in Fluent. 
 
"Limiter filter on": Applies the limiter without smoothing. 
 
"Limiter filter off": Smooths how the limiter is applied between neighboring cells to reduce limiter-induced noise/instability.
 
When processing time series of Kulite points a linear interpolation was used to best approximate for the specific coordinates given the low mesh resolution.
