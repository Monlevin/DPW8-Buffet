- Both SA and SST-kw turbulence model used the Spalart-Shur correction for curvature.
- For SA model a pseudo-transient formulation is used with a pseudo-transient time-step of 5e-4 s.
- For SST-kw model convergence for 3 and 3.1 deg was challenging given global flowfield instability. Pseudo-transient formulation was also used with pseudo-transient time-step ranging between 1e-4 s and 1e-6 s.
- Converged steady-state solutions were not achieved using SST-kw for the grid level 4, alpha = 3 and 3.1 deg.
- Convergence data for SST-kw model was not recorded.
